`record_result` is a Dart package that provides a type called `Result` for handling the outcomes of operations. It can represent either a successful result or a failure, allowing you to handle errors in a more functional and expressive way.

## Getting Started ðŸŽ‰

Add the following dependency to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  record_result: ^1.0.0
```

Then run:

```bash
dart pub get
```

## Usage ðŸ˜Ž

### Basic Result Types

**Result**

A `Result` is a type that represents either a success or a failure. It contains either a successful value (`success`) or an unsuccessful value represented by a `Failure`.

Example:

```dart
Result<int> result = right(42);
if (result.isSuccess) {
  print('Operation succeeded with result: ${result.success}');
} else {
  print('Operation failed with error: ${result.failure!.errorMessage}');
}
```

**FutureResult**

A `FutureResult` is a type that represents a `Future` of a `Result`. It is useful for working with asynchronous operations that may produce either a successful result or a failure.

Example:

```dart
FutureResult<int> futureResult = fetchSomeData();
futureResult.then((result) {
  if (result.isSuccess) {
    print('Operation succeeded with result: ${result.success}');
  } else {
    print('Operation failed with error: ${result.failure!.errorMessage}');
  }
});
```

**StreamResult**

A `StreamResult` is a type that represents a `Stream` of a `Result`. It is useful for handling asynchronous streams of results, where each element can be either a success or a failure.

Example:

```dart
StreamResult<int> streamResult = fetchDataAsStream();
await for (Result<int> result in streamResult) {
  if (result.isSuccess) {
    print('Received successful result: ${result.success}');
  } else {
    print('Received failure: ${result.failure!.errorMessage}');
  }
}
```

**ResultVoid**

A `ResultVoid` is a type that represents either a void `success` or a `Failure`. This type is useful when the operation doesn't produce a specific value, and success is indicated by the absence of a failure.

Example:

```dart
ResultVoid result = voidSuccess;
if (result.isSuccess) {
  print('Operation succeeded!');
} else {
  print('Operation failed with error: ${result.failure!.errorMessage}');
}
```

**FutureResultVoid**

A `FutureResultVoid` is a type that represents a `Future` of a `ResultVoid`. It is used for asynchronous operations that don't produce a specific value, and success is indicated by the absence of a failure.

Example:

```dart
FutureResultVoid futureResult = performAsyncOperation();
futureResult.then((result) {
  if (result.isSuccess) {
    print('Operation succeeded!');
  else {
    print('Operation failed with error: ${result.failure!.errorMessage}');
  }
});
```

**StreamResultVoid**

A `StreamResultVoid` is a type that represents a `Stream` of a `ResultVoid`. It is used for handling asynchronous streams of results where each element can be either a void success or a failure.

Example:

```dart
StreamResultVoid streamResultVoid = fetchDataAsStream();
await for (ResultVoid result in streamResultVoid) {
  if (result.isSuccess) {
    print('Received successful result!');
  } else {
    print('Received failure: ${result.failure!.errorMessage}');
  }
}
```

## Additional Utility Methods ðŸ’ª

### Fold Extension

The `Fold` extension provides additional utility methods for handling success and failure scenarios. This works on all `Result` types

Example:

```dart
Result<int> result = right(42);
String output = result.fold(
  (success) => 'Success: $success',
  (failure) => 'Failure: ${failure.errorMessage}',
);
print(output); // Output: Success: 42
```

### `right` and `left` Functions

The `right` and `left` functions are utility functions for creating instances of `Result`.

#### **`right`**

The `right` function creates a successful `Result` with the specified value.

Example:
```dart
Result<int> result = right(42);
```

#### **`left`**

The `left` function creates an unsuccessful result with the specified `Failure`.

Example:
```dart
final failure = Failure(message: 'Something went wrong', statusCode: 500);
Result<String> result = left(failure);
```
